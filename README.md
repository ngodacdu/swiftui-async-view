AsyncView â€“ Asynchronous loading operations in SwiftUI

In the following tutorial, a SwiftUI View component is developed for handling in-progress and error states when loading data asynchronously, based on an example project that loads JSON data via async/await. This serves as an exercise in creating abstractions and using Swift generics in practice.

The resulting component is suitable as a ready-made package for use in projects that merely want to load data from URL endpoints and display it via SwiftUI, as well as a starting point for projects that require a more complex structure.
